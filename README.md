## Current status

Word of caution: React Sense is still under development and all API's are subject to change.

## Introduction

React Sense is a UI Library that helps you write React.js Applications with a UI start pack that is similar to React-Native

## Goals

- Create a small reusable library for quick prototyping in React.
- Familiar API to React-Native
- Foundational Design based on Material Design
- Support for the FLIP technique to give developers easy access to performant animations

## Future

React Sense is aiming for a base component library to be released on the 12th of May. At that point the project will be at version 0.2.0

Version 0.3.0 will include FLIP animation components
